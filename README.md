# zed-nvim-integration

I like zed's file tree. I'm not quite sold on the editor yet, but until I am, this fork enables me to combine the strength of zed's filetree with the extensibility of neovim.

## How to use

Compile as described [in zed's official guide](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/docs/src/development/)

Then launch your vim instance passing `--listen 127.0.0.1:6666` as a start parameter.
